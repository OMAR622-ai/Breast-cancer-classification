Breast Cancer Classification Using CNN: A Comparative Analysis of Scratch and Pretrained Models
Abstract
Breast cancer classification is crucial for early diagnosis and treatment planning. This study implements and compares two convolutional neural network (CNN) approaches: a model trained from scratch and a pretrained model. The objective is to classify breast cancer subtypes with high accuracy. The pretrained model demonstrates superior generalization, achieving 92% accuracy, highlighting its potential for real-world clinical applications.

Methodology
Dataset: A publicly available breast cancer histopathological image dataset was used. The dataset was preprocessed to normalize pixel values and augment images for improved model generalization.
CNN from Scratch: A custom deep CNN architecture was designed and trained from the ground up using multiple convolutional layers, batch normalization, dropout, and fully connected layers.
Pretrained Model: A state-of-the-art CNN (e.g., ResNet, VGG, or EfficientNet) was fine-tuned for breast cancer classification.
Training & Optimization: The Adam optimizer and cross-entropy loss function were used. The models were trained using a stratified split of training and validation data.
Evaluation Metrics: Performance was assessed using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Results
CNN from Scratch: Achieved moderate accuracy due to limited feature extraction capabilities and overfitting risks.
Pretrained Model: Achieved 92% accuracy, demonstrating superior feature extraction and transfer learning efficiency.
Conclusion
Pretrained CNN models outperform custom models in breast cancer classification, proving their efficacy in medical image analysis. Future work will explore model interpretability using Grad-CAM and further optimization techniques to enhance classification robustness.
